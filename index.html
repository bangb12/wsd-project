			<a name="summary"><em>The World God Only Knows</em></a> is an anime (Started out as a Manga)
			starring young <strong>Keima Katsuragi</strong>, a second year high school   student, who enjoys
			dating simulation games. He is considered a <em>otamegane</em> because of this
			obsession. The series begins and Keima is considered to be a "God" amongst
			other dating sim players. Keima is Able to beat and obtain every route in 
			these games, which is what netted him this title.
			</p>
			<p>
			Keima is contacted constantly by people asking how to beat certain games,
			or asking him to beat them. However, he receives a mysterious e-mail 
			asking him to "conquer" girls, which he promptly accepts thinking that
			someone had sent him an invitation to a game. Much to his surprise a demon
			girl named <strong>Elsie</strong> appears to tell him that she needs help capturing "Loose
			souls"
			</p>
			<p>
			These souls are runaways from Hell, and they hid within the hearts of girls.
			Keima's job is to use his skills to make them fall in love with him to fill
			in the gaps that the loose souls use to hide. He is, however, only interested
			in virtual women and only agrees to do it because the contract is done, and
			<span class="highlight">they would both (Keima and Elsie) die</span> if they didn't complete the contract.
