		<h3> Intent of the Site </h3>
		<p> The intent of our re-design is to give  parents an easy way to get information about the school, moving away from the clutter and organizing everything. We need the site to be easy to navigate and have all necessary information in plain sight. We want to be sure that anyone, even those who are not very knowledgeable of computers, are able to get the information they need quickly. Use of good CTAs and a good navigation are required for it to be easy for parents to use. The website also needs to have a sharp design with accurate color matching to ensure the best experience possible. We want to keep them on the website to find what they need, and keep them coming back to a pleasant experience. </p>

	<h3> Target Audience </h3>
	<p> The main target audience of the website would be the parents of kids in 1st through 5th grade. Parents will want to know what their kids are doing, and be able to relay information to them (Like what is for lunch.) They are generally very busy people, and as such we strive to streamline everything so that they don't leave the site based on the amount of time it takes to find the information they desire. With this streamlined process we will ensure that parents will come back to the website to review new information that will be readily available. </p>
